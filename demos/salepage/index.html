							Just a few short years ago I was a scrawny high school kid who literally had to stop playing football because I was so skinny I was in danger of getting hurt.
						</p>
						<p>
							I knew it came down to my diet and training, but I had no clue how to fix it. I had already wasted years lifting weights and I thought I was eating the right foods.
						</p>
						<p>
							I tried different workouts I found online and wasted a mountain of money on supplements I knew nothing about.
						</p>
						<p>
							It took years of painstaking study and frustrating trial and error before I finally cracked the code on what actually works in the real world.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the most important lessons I learned is that “one-size-fits-all” approaches simply don’t produce the massive results you deserve and desire…
						</p>
						<p>
							And they almost always end in a depressing plateau that stops your progress like a brick wall.
						</p>
						<p>
							When I finally mastered diet and fitness and figured out exactly what nutrition and training plan was the exact fit for me…
						</p>
						<p>
							That’s when I started seeing drastic changes in the mirror that I never thought possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							My physical appearance changed rapidly because I had finally discovered the secrets to transforming the human body.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can see my transformation from skinny high school kid to fashion model in the photos below…

							My personal transformation had such a positive impact on me that I decided to commit my life to helping people get the results they deserve in record time.
						</p>
						<p>
							And if you’re as serious as I think you are about transforming your body and getting in the best shape of your life as quickly as humanly possible…
						</p>
						<p>
							Then I’d like to be your coach…
						</p>
						<p>
							I don’t want anyone to suffer through the frustrating experience I just described.
						</p>
						<p>
							Why take years to achieve the spectacular, life-changing transformation you can achieve in just 12 weeks.

						<p>
							You don’t have to be a professional athlete or a celebrity to have me – a certified personal trainer and fitness model – as your personal coach.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even better, it won’t cost you thousands of dollars – not even close.

						<p>
							<span class="color-pink"><strong>A coach…</strong></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							In fact, most have several coaches.
						</p>
						<p>
							Take a quarterback in football for example…
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="color-pink"><strong>They have a quarterback coach</strong></span>, an offensive coordinator, and a head coach…

						</p>
						<p>
							Actors are no different.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="color-pink"><strong>They have acting or drama coaches</strong></span>, personal trainers, and nutritionists or dieticians all helping them to look and perform their best on camera.
						</p>
						<p>
							Athletes and actors pay upwards of <span class="color-pink"><strong>$10,000</strong></span> or more per month to get the professional coaching they need to reach their potential and perform at the highest level.
						</p>
						<p>
							Because they know their investment in themselves will accelerate their success and pay off many times over.

						<p>
							<span class="color-pink"><strong>Coaches also help you break through plateaus so you don’t waste weeks, months</strong></span>, or years frustrated by your lack of progress.

						<p>
							You could reasonably expect a registered dietician to charge you $175 per hour to put together a personalized diet plan.
						</p>
						<p>
							That would take at least 2 hours if the dietician really took the time to get to know you and put together the best plan to reach your goals.
						</p>
						<p>
							So conservatively, you’re looking at $350.
						</p>
						<p>
							Personal trainers charge $50 to $100 per session depending on their experience and where you live.
						</p>
						<p>
							Let’s be conservative and say you find a good personal trainer for $50 per session.
						</p>
						<p>
							With 3 workouts per week, you’re looking at $150 per week or $600 per month.
						</p>
						<p>
							For 12 weeks (3 months), you could expect to pay $1,800 for the personal trainer plus another $350 for the customized diet plan from a registered dietician.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="color-red"><strong>That’s a total of $2,150 ($1,800 + $350).</strong></span>

						<p>
							You’ll pay only a small fraction of that figure when you hire me as your coach today.
						</p>
						<p>
							You’ve already demonstrated your commitment by investing in the “<strong>Ripped in 90 Days</strong>” program.
						</p>
						<p>
							And I want to reward you for that…
						</p>
						<p>
							So for now at least, I’m going to offer you personalized coaching plus a customized diet and fitness plan for just <strong>$297</strong>…

						<p>
							This is a 90-day program so that works out to a measly <strong>$3.30</strong> per day – less than what you probably pay for a gym membership.
						</p>
						<p>
							And if a gym membership alone was producing the result you want, you wouldn’t be reading this important message.
						</p>
						<p>
							If <strong>$3.30</strong> is too much to get in the best shape of your life, then you’re not serious about transforming your body and this offer is not for you.
						</p>
						<p>
							There’s nothing wrong with that. You WILL get results with the “<strong>Ripped in 90 Days</strong>” program.
						</p>
						<p>
							It will just take longer because you won’t have a coach creating custom plans for you and helping you break through frustrating plateaus with simple tweaks.
						</p>
						<p>
							And if you change your mind tomorrow…
						</p>
						<p>
							I can’t guarantee the price will be this low or that there will even be any spots available because there is <strong>LIMITED SPACE AVAILABLE</strong>.

							P.S. Let’s face it. With so much conflicting information available, nutrition and fitness can be a complicated maze.

						<p>
							A personal coach who custom designs diet and workout plans tailored to your specific needs can help you cut through the crap and achieve transformational results faster than you ever imagined possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							Those who are truly serious about achieving peak performance as quickly as possible and more importantly maintaining that high level have coaches.

							Brad Pitt didn’t become “The World’s Sexiest Man” or rise to the top of the Hollywood pay scale by chance.
